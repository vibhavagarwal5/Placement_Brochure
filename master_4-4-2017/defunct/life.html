												From regular movie nights organised by the 
												Multimedia club, to the electronic system design 
												workshops conducted by the college, we try to 
												ensure everyone’s interests are covered.

												AIKYAM, our social and community outreach has 
												played a leading role in helping poor children 
												build a happy bright future, while the Environment 
												Club ensures that we give back to nature.</p>

											<p>Welcome to IIIT-Bangalore.
											Many of you are familiar with IIIT-B as a place to recruit high-quality 
											M.Tech. graduates in IT. Starting this year, we are offering M.Tech. 
											graduates in an additional specialization – Electronic System Design 
											(ESD). Within ESD, students will graduate in the stream of Embedded 
											Systems, or of System-on-Chip (SoC) design.

											With highly qualified faculty involved in research in diverse areas 
											within ESD, state-of-the-art lab facilities and the usual high-quality 
											students, our M.Tech. (ESD) program is producing excellent outcomes.

											So we welcome recruiters with an interest in embedded systems, 
											digital and analog VLSI design, SoC and NoC design. I can assure you 
											that our graduates in ESD will be second to none. 

											Happy Recruiting!

											S. Sadagopan</p>

											</header>

											

											<p>Dear Corporate Friends,

											IIIT-Bangalore is one of the best Post-Graduate institutions in India for higher education in IT, 
											Electronic System Design and related areas. With an impressive faculty profile, a deeply ingrained 
											culture of academic excellence and work ethic and a transparent, informal and culturally rich 
											atmosphere, most of our students find IIIT-B an institution of the kind they have always dreamt 
											about. Academically the emphasis at IIIT-B has always been on ensuring that the students get a 
											sound conceptual foundation and on enabling them with problem solving skills of a higher order, 
											allowing students to live up to the rather demanding expectations from them in each of our 
											courses.

											We welcome you to our campus for the Placement recruitment. We hope you will cherish
											your time at our campus. We are sure our students will make you proud as your colleagues.</p>
